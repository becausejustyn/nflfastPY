    "# What is Survival Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis) is used to study the **time** until some **event** of interest (often referred to as **death**) occurs.  Time could be measured in years, months, weeks, days, etc.  The event could be anything of interest.  It could be an actual death, a birth, a Pokemon Go server crash, etc. In this post we are interested in how long drafted NFL players are in the league, so the event of interest will be the retirement of drafted NFL players. The duration of time leading up to the event of interest can be called the **survival time**. In our case, the survival time is the number of years that a player was active in the league (according to [Pro Football Reference](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the players in this analysis are still active players (e.g. Aaron Rodgers, Eli Manning, etc.), so we haven't observed their retirement (the event of interest).  Those players are considered **censored**. While we have some information about their career length (or survival time), we don't know the full length of their career.  This specific type of censorship, one in which we do not observe end of the survival time, is called **right-censorship**.  The methods developed in the field of survival analysis were created in order to deal with the issue of censored data.  In this post we will use one such method, called the [Kaplan-Meier estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator), to estimate the survival function and construct the survival curve for an NFL career.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A brief comment on the data used\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the draft data scraped from my [previous post](http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nfl-draft.html). The duration of a player's career is just the difference between \"To\" value from the [PFR draft table](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/draft.htm) and the year the player was drafted.  Players were considered active, if there name was in bold.  However there are may be some players who are retired that PFR still considers active (e.g. Mike Kafka). You can check out how I prepared the data in [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/savvastj/nfl_survival_analysis/blob/master/Data_Prep.ipynb). Let me know if you see any issues/mistakes I've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is the Survival Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The [survival function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_function), $S(t)$, of a population is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S(t) = Pr(T > t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital $T$ is a [random variable](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/random-variables-topic/random-variables-prob-dist/v/random-variables) that represents a subject's survival time. In our case $T$ represents an NFL player's career length. Lower case $t$ represents a specific time of interest for $T$. In our analysis the $t$ represents a specific number of years played. In other words the survival function just gives us the probability that someone survives longer than (or at least as long as) a specified value of time, $t$.  So in the context of our analysis, $S(3)$ will provide us the probability that an NFL career lasts longer than 3 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is the Kaplan-Meier estimator?\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the survival function of NFL players we will use the Kaplan-Meier estimator.  The Kaplan-Meier estimator is defined by the following product (from the [`lifelines` documentation](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Intro%20to%20lifelines.html#estimating-the-survival-function-using-kaplan-meier)):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where $d_i$ are the number of death events at time $t$ and $n_i$ is the number of subjects at risk of death just prior to time $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk through a simple example in a bit in order to get a better understanding of the above definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Estimating the Survival Function of NFL Players\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the survival function of NFL players we will be using the [`lifelines` library](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  It provides a user friendly interface for survival analyis using Python. Lets get started by importing what we need and reading in the data."
